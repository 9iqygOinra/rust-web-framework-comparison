# How to Use Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3 for Remote Camera Control
 
Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3 is a software development kit that allows users to control Canon cameras remotely from a Windows or Mac PC and use the same code across all compatible Canon cameras[^1^]. It provides access to various camera functions, such as shooting, live view, settings, downloading images, and more.

In this article, we will show you how to use Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3 to create a simple application that can capture images from a connected Canon camera and display them on the screen.
 
## Prerequisites
 
To use Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3, you will need the following:
 
- A compatible Canon camera with a USB cable. You can check the list of supported cameras [here](https://www.canon-europe.com/business/imaging-solutions/sdk/).
- A Windows or Mac PC with Visual Studio or Xcode installed.
- The Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3 package, which you can download from [here](https://asia.canon/en/campaign/developerresources/digital-camera-software-development-kit-faq).
- The Canon.EDSDK NuGet package, which you can install from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Canon.EDSDK/).

## Steps
 
Here are the steps to use Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3 for remote camera control:

1. Create a new project in Visual Studio or Xcode and add a reference to the Canon.EDSDK.dll or Canon.EDSDK.framework file from the Canon Digital EOS SDK ED SDK V2.3 package.
2. Initialize the EDSDK library by calling `EdsInitializeSDK()` at the start of your application.
3. Get a list of available cameras by calling `EdsGetCameraList()`. This will return an array of camera references that you can use to access each camera.
4. Select a camera from the list and open a session with it by calling `EdsOpenSession()`. This will allow you to communicate with the camera and send commands to it.
5. Set the camera to PC-controlled mode by calling `EdsSetPropertyData()` with the property ID `kEdsPropID_CaptureTransferMode` and the property data `kEdsCT_TransferToPC`. This will enable the camera to send captured images to the PC instead of saving them on the memory card.
6. Create a callback function that will handle the image data received from the camera. The callback function should have the following signature: `EdsError EDSCALLBACK handleObjectEvent(EdsObjectEvent event, EdsBaseRef object, EdsVoid * context)`. The callback function should check if the event is `kEdsObjectEvent_DirItemRequestTransfer`, which indicates that an image is ready to be transferred, and then call `EdsDownload()` to download the image data to a file or memory stream.
7. Register the callback function with the camera by calling `EdsSetObjectEventHandler()` with the event type `kEdsObjectEvent_All`. This will notify your application of any object events that occur on the camera, such as image capture, image transfer, etc.
8. Capture an image from the camera by calling `EdsSendCommand()` with the command `kEdsCameraCommand_TakePicture`. This will trigger the shutter release on the camera and send the image data to your callback function.
9. Display the image on your screen using your preferred method, such as using a picture box control or drawing on a canvas.
10. Close the session with the camera by calling `EdsCloseSession()` when you are done.
11. Terminate the EDSDK library by calling `EdsTerminateSDK()` at the end of your 0f148eb4a0
